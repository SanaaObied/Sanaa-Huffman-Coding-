Overview 
This project focuses on implementing Huffman Coding, a widely used lossless compression algorithm. The process involves reading a file, calculating byte frequencies, constructing a Huffman tree, and generating a compressed file. The project includes both compression and decompression phases, ensuring the original data is accurately restored. A graphical interface will be used to display results.
